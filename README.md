## Disclaimer

VRChat does not officially support use of their API outside of the VRChat client, 
so using this tool could get your account suspended without warning at any time.
While the program tries not to access either API excessively, 
there's no guarantee that this won't be deemed excessive by VRChat's moderators in the future.
I do not hold responsibility if you modify the program in any way that results in your account being terminated.
Use at your own risk.

This is the official statement from Tupper, their community manager:

> Use of the API using applications other than the approved methods (website, VRChat application) are not officially supported. You may use the API for your own application, but keep these guidelines in mind:
> * We do not provide documentation or support for the API.
> * Do not make queries to the API more than once per 60 seconds.
> * Abuse of the API may result in account termination.
> * Access to API endpoints may break at any given time, with no warning.
